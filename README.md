The Active Loan Bot is an automation project built using Automation Anywhere that streamlines the loan management process. This bot focuses on processing active loans, filtering important loan data, and generating reports, ensuring faster decision-making and improved accuracy.

It automates the following tasks:

Reading loan data from Excel files

Filtering active loans based on criteria (e.g., status = ACTIVE)

Processing loan amounts and related information

Exporting the results to a new file or system for further processing

This project is designed to handle large datasets, minimizing manual intervention and improving operational efficiency.
